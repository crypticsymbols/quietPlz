DNS proxy server with blacklist. Advertising and invasive tracking services must die.

Usage: set the DNS server on your machine or device to `192.241.190.60`. DNS requests for any domain listed in blacklist.js will be ignored, and all others will be proxied to 8.8.8.8 (Google).

Feel free to run your own instance: `sudo node server.js`
